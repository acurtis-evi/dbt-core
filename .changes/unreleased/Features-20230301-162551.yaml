  This removes the selector check when the yaml is read in and treats it like any other method. This allows the dictionary to serve as a reference and selectors to be included in the normal command line syntax. This also supports decorators on the selector:some_selector.

  I also added --exclude as a way of specifying exclude logic in a single string.

  dbt ls --select 'selector:some_selector+1 --exclude selector:some_selector'
  would select the children of some_selector one level and then subsequently remove the original.

  Most of the code removes the selectors dictionary from being passed around and instead opts to pass the project to the graph/cli get_selected and get_graph_queue methods.

  Also supports syntax like

  - definition:
      union:
        - selector:some_other_selector+1 --exclude some_model+2
      name: some_selector
