  In my company, we have a need to run operations on our materialized tables such as user deletion requests.  The dbt run-operation is single threaded and doesn't take advantage of the node yml structure.  Other submaterializations might be things like 'clone' which just implements snowflake's clone feature.

  I was thinking that an improvement would be to (for a particular model)

  materialized: incremental
  submaterializations:
    - user_delete

  Another model might be

  materialized: table
  submaterializations:
    - user_delete


  Materializations named incremental_user_delete and table_user_delete could be created to match above

  And it could be run using

  dbt run-sub --submaterialization user_delete ...

  Any model which has the submaterialization would respond to the above run and it would use the dag order / threads to run the operation.
